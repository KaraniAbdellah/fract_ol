	Step 2: Setup
		Install miniLibX, pthread, and math libraries.
		Read about libraries
		miniLibX: https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html
		
		Info & Installation about miniLibX:
			MiniLibX: is a simple graphics library for creating basic graphics without
			needing to know about X-Window or Cocoa. It helps you make windows, 
			draw shapes, handle images, and manage events easily.	
		
			X-Window: is a system that helps display graphics on Unix computers.
			It allows you to run programs that show images and windows.
			
			Installation:
				MiniLibX requires some libraries to work properly. Install these using the following command:
				''sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev''
			Download MiniLibX:
				''git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git mlx_linux''
					clone miniLibX in new folder names mlx_linux
				''cd mlx_linux''
				''./configure'': For checks your system for the tools and libraries needed 
					to build the software. It also sets up the Makefile with the right settings for your computer.
				''make'':
					compile and configure the MiniLibX library itself.
				in your main project create Makefile:
					this for compile the source code.
					
		Info & Installation about pthread:
			You don't need to install pthread, It is typically included with the system libraries,
			and you can use it directly by including pthread.h.
